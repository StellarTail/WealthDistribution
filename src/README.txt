To run the codes, users need to using command following compulsry parameters as below:
-javac Simulation.java
-java Simulation param[1] param[2] param[3] param[4] param[5] param[6] param[7] param[8]

Parameters explaining: 
param[1] is the number of initial people of the model
param[2] is the max vision of an individual
param[3] is the max metabolism of an individual
param[4] is the min life expectancy of an individual
param[5] is the max life expectancy of an individual
param[6] is the percentage of best lands of the model
param[7] is the interval between two harvest
param[8] is the grains can be harvest everytime
